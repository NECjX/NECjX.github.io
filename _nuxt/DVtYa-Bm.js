Her answers are the result of an algorithm and commands. </li><li><b>What data does Anna store?</b> Anna remembers the unique chat ID, the unique user ID and the user name (the name is updated from time to time) - this is necessary for her work. She doesn&#39;t know any more data and doesn&#39;t want to know. She takes the chat names and the username directly from the message. </li><p></p><li><b>How do I remove myself from Anna&#39;s memory?</b> Anna will automatically delete the player and everything related to him in a month and a half when she does not find a chat in common with him. But this month is multiplied by the level. To delete from memory, you need to delete Anna from the chat and wait. </li><li><b>Why Anna not answering?</b> Anna either does not know what to say (try to put it differently), or if a command is called, it is turned off for updating or sleeps at all (try later). She usually falls asleep at night. </li></ul><h5>Commands</h5><p> Anna in Telegram understands the commands.\\n\\nDrift (enter to the [[Drift]])\\n\\nFishing, Digging\\n\\nInventory (your own or someone else&#39;&#39;s, if you answer someone)\\n\\nInspect [item number] (responding to a message with an open inventory to whose item you need to study)\\n\\nSell [item number] (responding to a message with an own open inventory)\\n\\nBuy [item number] (responding to a message with an open inventory to whose item you need to buy)\\n\\nProfile (your own or someone else&#39;s, if you answer someone)\\n\\nAnd many others... You need to write Commands to find out the list. </p><h5>Minigames</h5><p> Anna can start minigames in chats, like [[Drift]] or fishing trips, or rock-paper-scissors... Just add her in any Telegram chat and continue to talk, or just join [[HIVE.cafe|HIVE.caf√©]]. </p><h5>Critics</h5><p> Criticized because of a worse conversation algorithm compared to ChatGPT, which has over a billion dollars of investment. </p></section></article>',4),X={class:"üá¨üá© üá¨üá©-E4",id:"facts"},Z={class:"üá¨üá©-E"},ee={class:"nav"},te=e("ul",{class:"list-numeric style-decimal"},[e("li",null," The image of Anna adorns the main page [[NECjAR]] more than ten years.
