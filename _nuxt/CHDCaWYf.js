The test vehicle is positioned such that the driver’s side forms a 63 degree angle with the test track. On the other end of the test track is a chassis with a barrier also turned at a 63 degree angle. The barrier is made of a deformable material to replicate the front of another vehicle and is attached to a cable that tows\\nit down a track into the test vehicle at 90 km/h. Both the barrier face and the driver’s side of the vehicle are parallel, so that the entire face of the barrier impacts the side of the vehicle. </p><h4>Rollover Test</h4><p> The dynamic rollover test simulates a driver making a high-speed collision avoidance maneuver—steering sharply in one direction, then sharply in the other direction—within about 1 second. NCAP has focused its rollover test primarily on pickups and SUVs because cars are not susceptible to tipping up in this test. The rollover test is actually a series of four runs, two left/right tests and two right/left tests, at two different steering wheel angles and different speeds. Before the test, the vehicle is loaded to represent five passengers and a full tank of gas. During the test, the steering wheel is turned sharply in one direction at a high speed and then turned sharply in the opposite direction at a greater steering angle. The first run of each test is conducted at 80 km/h. Subsequent runs are conducted at about 90 km/h, 100 km/h, 110 km/h and 120 km/h, until the vehicle fails or “tips up” as defined by test procedures or attains a speed of 120 km/h on the last run of each test without tipping up. Tipping up is defined as both wheels on one side of the vehicle lifting off the ground more than 2 inches simultaneously, which most commonly occurs during the second turn. Outriggers are attached to the vehicle to prevent it from tipping all the way over and injuring the test driver. </p><ul class="list-numeric style-decimal"><li> MPDB Frontal Impact, Oblique/Small Overlap </li><li> Barrier Side Impact </li><li> Pole Side Impact </li></ul><h4>Full Frontal Crash</h4><p> Test The full frontal crash test is the equivalent of two identical vehicles, both traveling at 80 km/h, crashing into each other head-on. The test vehicle is attached to a cable and towed along a track at 80 km/h so that the entire front end of the vehicle engages a fixed rigid barrier. </p><p> This type of crash test produces high level occupant deceleration, making this test demanding of the vehicle’s restraint system. </p></section></article><article class="🇬🇩 🇬🇩-E4" id="history"><section class="🇬🇩-E"><h4 class="nav">History</h4><p> The [Nectar Motors] division needed a program to test the designs of the first two prototypes of cars [Vica I] and [Cara I].
